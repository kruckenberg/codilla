You're looking at a JavaScript R.E.P.L. That stands for:

- Read
- Evaluate
- Print
- Loop

When you type in some JavaScript code, the JavaScript engine **reads** it,
**evaluates** it, **prints** the result, and **loops** back, waiting
again for you to give it another instruction. Pressing the "enter" key
let's the R.E.P.L. know you're done typing and ready for it to R., E. & P.

You don't need to know a thing about JavaScript to use it. For now, think of it
as a fancy calculator. Give it a try! Use the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators
to do a little arithmetic.

Does it follow the order of operations? Can you change the result by adding
parentheses?

Take note of anything that surprises or perplexes you.

When you're ready to move on, click the "Complete" button.
